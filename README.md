# Shopping Cart App

## Overview

This project is a simple shopping cart application built using React. It allows users to view products, add them to the cart, and manage the cart contents, including removing items.

## Design Choices

### React Components

1. **ProductDetailScreen**: Displays product details and allows adding items to the cart.
2. **Cart**: Displays the contents of the cart, allows removing items, and updates local storage accordingly.

### Styling

- CSS files (`FashionStore.css` and `cart.css`) are used for styling components to maintain separation of concerns and ensure consistent design.

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: Utilized for storing the cart items locally. Each time an item is added or removed from the cart, local storage is updated (`localStorage.setItem`).

### Routing

- **React Router**: Used for navigation between different views (`ProductDetailScreen` and `Cart`) within the application.
